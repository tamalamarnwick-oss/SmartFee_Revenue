# Student ID Duplicate Issue - Fixed!

## ✅ Issue Resolved: Duplicate Student ID Error

The error `sqlalchemy.exc.PendingRollbackError: UNIQUE constraint failed: student.student_id` has been successfully resolved!

## 🔧 Problem Identified

The error occurred because:
1. **Duplicate Student ID**: You were trying to add a student with ID '001' which already exists
2. **Database Constraint**: The `student_id` field has a UNIQUE constraint
3. **Session Rollback**: The database session was in a rolled-back state due to the constraint violation

- ✅ Added duplicate student ID validation before database insertion
- ✅ Added proper database session rollback on errors
- ✅ Added clear error messages for duplicate IDs

### 2. **Automatic Student ID Generation**

- ✅ IDs are generated in sequence (001, 002, 003, etc.)
- ✅ Added API endpoint for generating new IDs

### 3. **Improved User Interface**
- ✅ Pre-filled student ID field with generated ID
- ✅ Added "Generate New" button to create new IDs
- ✅ Added helpful text explaining the ID system
- ✅ Added real-time validation

### 4. **API Endpoints Added**
- ✅ `/api/generate_student_id` - Generate new student ID
- ✅ `/api/check_student_id/<id>` - Check if ID is available
