# Receipt Display and Numbering Fix

## Problem Description
The receipt generation system was not displaying properly and had issues with sequential numbering. The receipts should:
1. Display with sequential numbering starting from 0001, 0002, etc.
2. Show school name and address from School Settings
3. Display PTA Fund, SDF, and Boarding Fee payments with totals
4. Show two students per page when available, or one if only one student is available

## Files Modified

### 1. templates/professional_receipt.html
- **Status**: ✅ UPDATED
- **Changes**: Complete redesign of the receipt template with:
  - Proper sequential receipt numbering display
  - Clean, professional layout with school information
  - Payment details table showing PTA, SDF, and Boarding fees
  - Support for 1 or 2 students per page
  - Print-optimized styling
  - Proper cut-here separator between receipts

### 2. Backend Logic (app.py)
- **Status**: ⚠️ NEEDS MANUAL UPDATE
- **File**: `fix_receipt_numbering.py` contains the updated function
- **Changes Needed**: Replace the `print_professional_receipt()` function in app.py with the version from the fix file

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: The template is already updated
The `professional_receipt.html` template has been completely rewritten and is ready to use.

### Step 2: Update the Flask route
Replace the `print_professional_receipt()` function in `app.py` (lines 59-128) with the updated version from `fix_receipt_numbering.py`.

The key improvements in the backend:
- Tracks generated receipts in the ProfessionalReceipt table
- Prevents duplicate receipt generation for the same student
- Ensures sequential numbering starting from 0001
- Properly handles 1 or 2 students per page
