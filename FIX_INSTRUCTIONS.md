# Fix for Income Error: 'other_income_total' is undefined

## ðŸš¨ Problem
The income page is showing an error: `jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'other_income_total' is undefined`

This happens because the template `income.html` was updated to show the Other Income total, but the backend `app.py` wasn't updated to calculate and pass this variable.

## âœ… Solution

### Option 1: Run the Quick Fix Script (Recommended)
```bash
python quick_fix_income.py
```

### Option 2: Manual Fix
If you prefer to fix manually, add these lines to `app.py`:

1. **Around line 1520** (after the boarding_total calculation for current_school_id):
```python
        other_income_total = db.session.query(db.func.sum(OtherIncome.amount_paid)).filter_by(school_id=current_school_id).scalar() or 0
```

2. **Around line 1525** (after the boarding_total calculation for developer view):
```python
        other_income_total = db.session.query(db.func.sum(OtherIncome.amount_paid)).scalar() or 0
```

3. **Around line 1570** (in the render_template call, after boarding_total=boarding_total,):
```python
        other_income_total=other_income_total,
```

## ðŸŽ¯ What This Fixes
- âœ… Calculates the total amount paid from Other Income records
- âœ… Passes the `other_income_total` variable to the template
- âœ… Shows Other Income total alongside PTA, SDF, and Boarding totals
- âœ… Maintains school-specific filtering for multi-school setups

## ðŸš€ After Applying the Fix
1. Restart your Flask application
2. Navigate to the Income Management page
3. You should now see 4 total cards: PTA, SDF, Boarding, and **Other Income**
4. The Other Income tab will show customer names and income types with clear labels

## ðŸ“‹ Verification
The income page should now display:
- **4 summary cards** instead of 3 (including Other Income Total)
- **Enhanced Other Income display** with Customer and Type labels
- **No more undefined variable errors**
