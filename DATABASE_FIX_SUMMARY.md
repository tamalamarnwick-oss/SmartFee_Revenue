# Database Fix Summary

## ✅ Issue Resolved: Missing Database Columns

The error `sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) no such column: student.sex` has been successfully resolved!

## 🔧 Problem Identified

The database schema was missing the new columns that were added to the Student model:
- `sex` column (for storing student gender)
- `pta_installments` column (for tracking PTA payment installments)
- `sdf_installments` column (for tracking SDF payment installments)

## 🛠️ Solution Applied

### 1. **Database Location Found**
- Located the database at `instance/smartfee.db` (Flask's default location)
- Updated migration script to check both possible locations

### 2. **Columns Added Successfully**
- ✅ Added `sex` column with default value 'Male'
- ✅ Added `pta_installments` column with default value 0
- ✅ Added `sdf_installments` column with default value 0

### 3. **Data Migration Completed**
- Updated existing students to have default sex values
- Set installment counts based on existing payment data
- Preserved all existing data
